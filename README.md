![Main menu](/IMG_1413.jpg)
The main menu page allows users to choose between different levels, each representing a different algorithm. Users cannot skip levels; they must successfully complete the previous one to unlock the next.
When hovering over a level, a simple image is displayed to visually represent the algorithm, along with a brief description shown underneath.
Users can also access the leaderboard, where rankings are based on the number of levels completed and the time taken to complete them ‚Äî the less time a user takes, the more points they earn.
Additionally, users can visit their profile to display their name, email, or log out.

After selecting a certain level, a preparation screen is shown first, where users can visually explore how the algorithm works, read its explanation, and review the corresponding code.
